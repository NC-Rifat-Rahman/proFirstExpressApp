## THEORY
# SELECT Clause
- We can use arithmetic operations on columns
- We can use "AS" to change alias name of a column
- Use 'DISTINCT' to fethch non-duplicate records

# WHERE Clause
- use it to apply conditions

# AND, OR NOT Operator
- AND has higher order than OR. That means if query has both AND and OR operator the AND operator will be excuted first. 
    We can change the order using paranthesis.
- NOT is used to negate a condition.

# IN Operator
- An example : 
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE state = "VA" OR state = "GA" OR state = "FL"
    By using IN operator the equivalent query will be
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE state IN ('VA','FL','GA')

# BETWEEN Operator
- An example :
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points >= 1000 AND points <= 3000
    By using BETWEEN operator the equivalent quer will be
    SELECT * FROM customer WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000

# LIKE Operator
- An example : 
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%'. [It will give results where customers last name starts with B]
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '%b%'. [It will give results where customers last name contains b in nay place of the last name]
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '%b'. [It will give results where customers last name ends with b]

    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '_____y'. [It will give results where lastname contains exact numbers of characters as underscore and followed by y]

- (%) represents any number of characters && (_) represents single character

# REGEXP Operator
- It is powerful when searching for strings.
- An example : 
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '&field'
    Equivalent to : 
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field'
- it has (^) ($) (|) signs. [Google for further info]
- ^ beginning of the string, $ end of the string, | logical OR, [] to match any single charcter listed in the bracket





** Exercise
* REGEXP
- Get the customers whose 
    1) first names are ELKA or AMBUR
    2) last names end with EY or ON
    3) last names start with MY or contains SE
    4) last names contain B followed by R or U

&& Solutions
& REGEXP
    1) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP 'ELKA | AMBUR'
    2) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP 'EY$ | ON$'
    3) SElECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP '^MY | SE'
    4) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name 'b[ru]' or use [br|bu]
